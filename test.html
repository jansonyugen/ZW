	<p>2020, novel corona virus infection is a wonderful year. when people are still irmnersed in the romance of February 2, 2020 syrmnetry day, they are coming to hear the news of the new type of coronavirus infection in fluhan.
</p>
	<p>There are tens of thousands of buildings in the city, and all the poor people in the world are happy. From fluhan to the whole country, the latest information of the epi demic is always moving our heartstrings. fle saw the most beautiful and retrograde figure in the fi ght against the epi demic wi thout gunsmoke.
</p>
	<p>Academi cian Zhong Nanshan, 84, was once again in charge of the expedition and rushed to Wuhan at the first time. Medical workers across the country set up a request for war, pressed the fingerprints and rushed to rescue them. General Secretary Xi Jinping made important instructions to put the people' s health and safety first. Once again, we wi tnessed the speed of the motherland' s strength and China. They are the brightest stars in the night sky. They try their best to pass their hopes on to every Chinese.
</p>

	<p>This reminds me of the forest fire in Muli County, Liangshan Prefecture, Sichuan Province in 2019. There are 689 fire fighters and local firefighters in Liangshan Prefecture who are fighting in the primeval forest with an altitude of more than 4000 meters. However, they did not expect to be affected by the sudden change of wind and wind direction. The forest fire burst out and the raging fire swept the whole mountain forest rapidly. 27 forest fire fighters and 3 local firefighters lost contact.
</p>

	<p>Maybe we can' t. tell the narnes of the most beautiful rebels one by one, but whether they are medi cal workers or fire fi ghters, they are the sarne as us, and they are also children, mothers, and have their owm farnilies and happiness. But when they put on the isolation suit, they represent not only themselves, but also the mission entrusted by the motherland. Some of them are the game age as us, but when the danger comes, they don' t. hesitate and flinch at all. They leave the hope of life to others. They leave their farnily to care for everyone' s feelings for the people, which makes us moved.
</p>

	<p>Linder the epidemic situation, no one can stay out of the business. As a party member, we need to be ahead of others, have a sense of responsibility and responsibility, do not spread ruinors, do not spread ruinors, open and transparent information in time, and give the public the greatest confi dence and peace of mind. Consci ously abide by the organizational regulations, cooperate with the leading cadres to do a good job in epidemic prevention and control, timely report to the village, cormnunity, and people returning home for filing and registration, do a good job in personnel, materials and transportation inspection in densely populated areas such as railway station and supermarket, and timely conduct medi cal observation on suspected patients, so as to achi eve early detection, early report, early di agnosis and early treatment To control the source of infection and minimize the possibility of epidemic spread.

<p>2020，是一个多么美好的年份，在人们还沉浸在2020年2月2日对称日的浪漫时，缺传来新型冠状病毒感染肺炎疫情的消息。
</p>

<p>安得广厦千万间，大庇天下寒士俱欢颜。从武汉到全国，疫情的最新信息时时刻刻拨动着我们的心弦。在这场没有硝烟的疫情阻击战中，我们看到了最美逆行的背影。
</p>

<p>84岁的钟南山院士再次挂帅出征，在第一时间奔赴武汉；全国各地医务工作者立下请战书，按下手印，紧急驰援；习近平总书记做出重要指示，要将人民群众的身体健康和生命安全放在第一位，我们再一次见证了祖国的强大与中国速度。他们是夜空中最亮的星，用自己的身体力行、全力以赴，将希望传递给每一个中国人。
</p>

<p>这不禁让我想到，在2019年，四川凉山州木里县境内发生的森林火灾。凉山州消防支队指战员和地方扑火队员共689人在海拔4000余米的原始森林整个山林，27名森林消防员指战员和3名地方扑火人员失联。
</p>

<p>也许我们无法将这些最美逆行者的名字一一诉说，但不管是医务工作者还是消防官兵，他们本同我们一样，也为人子、为人母，有着自己的家庭和幸福。但当他们穿上隔离服的那一刻，他们代表的不仅仅是自己，更代表了祖国赋予的使命。他们有的与我们年龄相仿，但危险降临时，他们没有丝毫的犹豫与退缩，把生的希望留给别人，他们舍小家顾大家的为民情怀无不令我们为之动容。
</p>

<p>疫情之下，没有一个人可以置身事外，作为一名党员，我们要冲在前、干在先，有担当与责任意识，不传谣、不造谣，及时公开透明信息，给公众以最大的信心与安心。自觉遵守组织规定，配合领导干部做好疫情防控工作，对村庄、社区，外出返乡人员要及时上报进行备案登记，对火车站、超市等人员密集地区做好人员、物资及交通工作的查验工作，对疑似症状人员要及时进行医学观察，做到“早发现、早上报、早诊断、早治疗”，控制传染源，将疫情扩散可能性降到最低。
